  Why should you become an exhibitor?

  Mobility is a lifestyle
  We want to show all the possibilities to become active on a global level. The world needs the Erasmus generation.

  We focus on diversity
  The mobility fair gives enterprises and NGOs an equal opportunity to present themselves and their projects.
  .
  Europe in one day
  The Mobility Fair is a part of the Annual General Meeting of Europe’s biggest student association. Regional and international exhibitors are going to meet a multitude of motivated young people with an international mindset, looking for new opportunities.

  From students to students
  The fair is organized by volunteers of the Erasmus Student Network. Our motivation is to show the benefits of mobility to young people and share our own experiences.

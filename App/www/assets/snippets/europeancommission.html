    The European Commission is the EU's politically independent executive arm. It was created in 1965 through the fusion
    of the High Authority of the European Coal and Steel Community, the Commission of the European Economic Community
    (EEC) and the Commission of the European Atomic Energy Community and has undergone numerous structural changes
    since. The European Commission is responsible for drawing up proposals for new European legislation, and it
    implements the decisions of the European Parliament and the Council of the EU. It is divided into departments known
    as Directorates General (DGs), roughly equivalent to ministries. Each covers a specific policy area or service such
    as trade or environment, and is headed by a Director-General who reports to a Commissioner. Overall, the Commission
    works under the leadership of a President. Around 33 000 people are employed by the European Commission.

<p><strong>Hostelling international</strong>
 is a federation of 70 National Associations, created by travellers to host people around the world. Wherever you go, we will offer you accommodation in 4,000 hostels in 80 countries from a night in a jet plane to a haunted house! Environment, sustainability and diversity are values that we take into consideration at every level of our activity creating projects and events that affect our guests and local community.
We are a non-governmental, non-for-profit organization working closely with UNESCO and the World Tourism Organization (UNWTO). For the last few years we have been a proud partner of Erasmus Student Network, offering ESNcard holders a 10% discount for accommodation.

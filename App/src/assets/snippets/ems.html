The programme "Europa macht Schule" (Europe meets School) brings the idea of inter-European exchange to life, increases the knowledge of cultures and provides a hands-on European experience. "Europa macht Schule" encourages Erasmus students to organise a cultural project with pupils in their host country. It supports incoming students by integrating them into local life outside the university campus. At the same time, it offers the possibility of gaining personal access to other European cultures for local pupils. Thus "Europa macht Schule" contributes to generating tolerance, awareness and understanding for other cultures. Furthermore, it contributes to the success of Erasmus mobility: It makes the exchange students feel welcome in their host country by integrating them in an appreciative way.

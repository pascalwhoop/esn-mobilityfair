            At STA Travel, we’ve been travelling the world spreading love, peace and adventure since 1979.<br>
            <br>
            Over 35 years later, our fashions may have changed (flares just weren't practical for adventure, and socks
            and sandals were just plain wrong) but as travellers, we haven't. We’re still just as wide-eyed with the
            world and just as bonkers about getting you out there to see it.

            Our story starts way back in 1979, in a magical era where flares were fashionable and affordable adventures
            were scarce. The location was Oz (not the magical one with the wizard, the Australian one) where two young
            students had just returned from their travels, slightly jetlagged but on the biggest high of their
            lives.<br>
            <br>
            Inspired by the planet, the people they had met and the places they had seen, they set out on a mission to
            bring affordable flights and worldly adventures to other students, young people and explorers. The result
            was STA Travel.<br>
            <br>
            That was over 35 years ago, and we've been travelling the world spreading love, peace and adventure ever
            since!<br>
            <br>
            Today we have almost 2,000 people working in over 200 stores around the globe, helping over 2 million
            travellers a year start their adventure.<br>
            <br>
